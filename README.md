[EN]: This repository serves as an index for various Terraform-based projects and code examples. Each linked repository demonstrates different aspects of Terraform usage, including infrastructure provisioning, module structuring, lifecycle management, and built-in functions. The goal is to provide practical examples that can be used as references for learning and development. For more in-depth discussions and technical articles, visit my LinkedIn and Medium profiles.
